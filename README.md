# COMPUTER WORLD
### PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
The Computer World Application is being used as the front-end for the Computer World API, which can be found here: [COMPUTER WORLD API](https://github.com/caleb-long19/ComputerWorld_API)

The application will allow users to manipulate various data, including, manufacturers, products, and create an order. The purpose of this project is to display my ability
