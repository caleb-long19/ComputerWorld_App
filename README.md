# COMPUTER WORLD
### PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
The Computer World Application is being used as the front-end for the Computer World API, which can be found here: [COMPUTER WORLD API](https://github.com/caleb-long19/ComputerWorld_API) 
<br />
<br />
The application will allow users to manipulate various data, including, manufacturers, products, and create an order. The purpose of this project is to display my ability 
to develop an api alongside an application to prepare for developing a large scale project.

## PROJECT DETAILS

## DESIGN CONCEPTS
  - NONE TO DISPLAY  

## TODO
```
- Implement the update function. Allow users to select an manufacturer, product, or order and have those details display in the form (possibly via selected index). Allow them to change the values in the boxes and submit the changes. Make sure to validate the form data before sending.
- Implement the delete function. Same as before, retrieve index, display details in a form and delete record from chosen table.
- Implement the create function. Possibly use a bool to ask the user if they wish to create a user, if no, proceed with update/delete, if yes, disable the selected index chosen and create the data.
- Finish off website design concepts to get a better idea of how the final front-end product will look.
- Finish off the remaining tutorials.
- Token based authentication.
- Talk with other team members for any feedback on the project code and website design.
