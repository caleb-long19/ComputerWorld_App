# COMPUTER WORLD
### PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
The Computer World Application is being used as the front-end for the Computer World API, which can be found here: [COMPUTER WORLD API](https://github.com/caleb-long19/ComputerWorld_API) 
<br />
<br />
The application will allow users to manipulate various data, including, manufacturers, products, and create an order. The purpose of this project is to display my ability 
to develop an api alongside an application to prepare for developing a large scale project.

## DESIGN CONCEPTS

## TODO
```
I received plenty of Feedback from Matt and I have spent some time going over the application and making a list of changes that need to be made to fit the standard.
- Alter all the service files, they should only be implementing try/catch methods (call and retrieve data only).
- Craft a component that is used to control the data retrieved.
- Implement Await & Async
- Take the user to the create page, after creating record, display data and take them to the edit page
- Implement environment variable and inject into code
- Don't store data inside of the service
- Utilise composables and components
- Remove duplicate code
```
